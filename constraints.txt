# Python package constraints for ans_dev_sandbox_playbook
# This file specifies packages that should NOT be installed to avoid conflicts

# pytest-ansible conflicts with pytest-testinfra (both register --inventory option)
# This causes argparse.ArgumentError during pytest initialization
# We only need pytest-testinfra for Molecule verify, so exclude pytest-ansible
# Uninstall after ansible-dev-tools installation with: pip uninstall -y pytest-ansible
